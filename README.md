# Student Management System

This project is a Student Management System built with Spring Boot, designed to manage student information such as Name, Email are added in code , and enrollment, grades, attendance, and more are to be added with additional layer of authentication and authorization.
This is just a basic version of it.
## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/A-AnilKumar/StudentManagementSystem.git
  ```

2. Import the project into your preferred IDE.

3. Set up your development environment by installing the necessary dependencies:

   - Java Development Kit (JDK)
   - Maven or Gradle for dependency management or wrapper.

4. Run the application:

   - The project comes pre-configured with Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, and MySQL drivers.
   - Configure your database connection properties in `application.properties` or `application.yml`.
   - Start the application and verify that it's running correctly.

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard Spring Boot project structure:

- **src/main/java**: Contains the Java source code.
  - **com.example.studentmanagement**: Main package for the application.
    - **controller**: Contains RESTful controllers to handle HTTP requests.
    - **model**: Contains entity classes representing database tables.
    - **repository**: Contains repositories/interfaces for CRUD operations.
    - **service**: Contains service classes encapsulating business logic.
- **src/main/resources**: Contains static resources and configuration files.
  - **application.properties**: Contains application properties, including database configuration.
  - **templates**: (If using Thymeleaf) Contains HTML templates for server-side rendering.

## Usage

### Entity Classes

- Create Java classes in the `model` package to represent your database entities.
- Use JPA annotations for mapping entities to database tables.

### Repositories

- Create repositories/interfaces in the `repository` package extending JpaRepository or CrudRepository.
- Perform CRUD operations on your entities using these repositories.

### Service Layer

- Implement service classes in the `service` package to encapsulate business logic.
- Perform operations like enrollment, attendance tracking, etc., in these classes.

### Controllers

- Create RESTful controllers in the `controller` package to handle HTTP requests.
- Define endpoints for CRUD operations and any other necessary functionalities.

### Views ( Thymeleaf used )

- If you want a UI, create HTML/CSS/JavaScript files in the `templates` directory.
- Use Thymeleaf or any frontend framework like React, Angular, or Vue.js to interact with your backend.

### Security ![Project Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Ongoing-brightgreen)

- Implement authentication and authorization using Spring Security if your application requires it.
- Configure security rules to restrict access to certain endpoints or resources.
